do more licenseing // what did i mean here?

remove clickme stuff, html and js // might be done

see notation at index_pi.js:304 // i guess i did clickme there

try removing all setTitle stuff, done // maybe put this back // no, we gonna remove it!!!!

do testing // stage 1 done // stage 2 done

send websockets, do pinStates // no, just json and strings // turns out they should be handled the same

maybe a this.ShowReaction(context, "Alert"); // need to find 'context'

remove images.sketch, make new icons // done, yay!! // redo icons

could probably remove doSomething, it looks like test code

test and build for distribution // release is in Release
