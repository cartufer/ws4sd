Web Socket client plugin for StreamDeck macro keyboard.
This project is a javascript project.
This project is going to have a sister project, just as soon as i pick a name for it.

This project is extremely 'work in progress' and is also just a pile of junk right now, don't attempt to use any of it.


Goals in order of priority;
send string based websockets to network devices.
receive integers to display.
auto-connect.
button outline colour to indicate connection status.
rgb colour picker in property inspector.
ssl.
